Huffman Coding is a popular algorithm for lossless data compression that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes given to more frequent characters.
The algorithm works by constructing a binary tree, known as the Huffman tree, where each leaf node represents a character and the path to each leaf node represents its corresponding code.
Executed the compress method to compress the file and obtain a .bin file.
Executed the decompress method to decompress the compressed file and obtain a _decompressed.txt file.
Data Structures Used:
